# An O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm.
# Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the
# implementation preserves the input order of equal elements
# in the sorted output.
# Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm

# Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
# 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists,
# each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
# 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until
# there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.


# one of mergesortâ€™s most attractive properties is
# that it guarantees to sort any array of N items in
# time proportional to N log N. Its prime
# disadvantage is that it uses extra space proportional to N.
